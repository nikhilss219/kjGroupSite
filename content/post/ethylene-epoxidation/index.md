Oxygen interaction on the Ag surface is studied, and based on structural and electronic properties, three electrophilic oxygen variants were identified. Our study concludes that the interaction between ethylene and these oxygen variants leads to direct epoxidation, provided there is appropriate overlap between the two, irrespective of the particular oxygen species involved.
