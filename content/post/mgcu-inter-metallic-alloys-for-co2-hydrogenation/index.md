The use of MgCu inter-metallic alloys in CO2 hydrogenation has been studied using DFT.

Specifically, two compositions, Mg2Cu and MgCu2, were investigated. When CO2 and H2O are co-adsorbed, -COOH is spontaneously formed on Mg2Cu(224), whereas a barrier of 0.04 eV is observed on MgCu2(311). It was also discovered that the direct dissociation of CO2 to CO + O is not energetically favorable due to a high activation barrier.
