Our research investigated various Single-atom Catalysts (SACs) of Cu(111)doped with twenty-two different transition and non-transition metals on copper (Cu) surface. We investigated methane activation on SACs doped on Cu(111) surface. We reported significant bond length activation and moderate adsorption energies with a smaller activation barrier. Concluding our research work, the computations observed Ru/Cu(111) and Co/Cu(111) SACs as promising candidates for potent methane activation, reporting C-H bond activation energy barrier and reaction energies of 0.17 eV, 0.24 eV, and 0.16 eV, 0.2 eV, respectively.
