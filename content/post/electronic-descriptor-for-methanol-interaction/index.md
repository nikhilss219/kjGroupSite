We have employed DFT-based computation to deduce trends and gain predictive power by understanding the results in terms of underlying electronic structure. We proposed a descriptor for determining the outcome of methanol (molecular adsorption or dissociation) with various Zn-based systems. We demonstrate the one-to-one correlation between the presence of energy states at fermi and the outcome of that facet's interaction with MeOH.
