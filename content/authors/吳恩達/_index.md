*Research in our group is driven by a quest to understand the underlying electronic structure of materials and how it affects their properties. Further, we explore ML-based methods to screen the chemical space for various materials with targeted properties.* 

Following are the themes the group is currently involved extensively in:

***Computational heterogeneous catalysis:*** We investigate industrially important reactions to uncover the principles governing the reactivity of catalysts to design better catalysts.

***In silico design of catalysts*** for various socially/environmentally relevant problems like CO2 to value-added products, gas to liquid etc. 

***Solid-state hydrogen storage:*** Hydrogen is the future fuel if the problem of storing it at ambient conditions could be tackled. We are working towards developing ML-based models to predict alloys suitable for solid-state hydrogen storage. 

***Machine learning-based approaches*** to screen chemical space or to predict the ground state structure
