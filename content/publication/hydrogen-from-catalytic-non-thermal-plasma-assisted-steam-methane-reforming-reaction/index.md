abstract: "Steam methane reforming reaction was carried out in a dielectric
  barrier plasma reactor. A systematic study is conducted to understand the
  influence of input power, flow rate, and water for the conversion, yield, and
  selectivity of the reaction over strategically designed catalysts. In
  particular, the production rate and selectivity of the products (H2, CO and C2
  hydrocarbons) are monitored. CeO2 was used as packing material, mixed with
  oxides of manganese or copper and their combination. The optimum Cu/CeO2
  catalyst illustrated the production rate of 248.7 μmolg−1h−1 and 11.25
  μmolg−1h−1 for H2, and CO, respectively at specific energy input of 19.8 JL-1.
  DFT calculations exhibit apparent change in electronic structure of the CeO2
  after inclusion of oxides of manganese and copper that enhance interaction
  with methane. "
