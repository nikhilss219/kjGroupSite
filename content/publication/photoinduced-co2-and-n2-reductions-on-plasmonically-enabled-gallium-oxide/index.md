  Ag-containing ZnO/ Î²-Ga2O3 semiconductor, which exhibit reduced bandgap,
  increased light absorption, and hydrophilicity, have been found to be useful
  for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and N2 fixation by water. The
  charge-separation is facilitated by the new interfaces and inherent vacancies.
  The Ag@GaZn demonstrated the highest photocurrent response, about 20- and
  2.27-folds that of the Ga and GaZn samples, respectively. CO, CH4, and H2
  formed as products for photo-reduction of CO2. Ag@GaZn catalyst exhibited the
  highest AQY of 0.121 % at 400 nm (31.2 W/m2). Also, Ag@GaZn generated 740 
   of NH4+ ions, which was about 18-folds higher than Ga sample. In situ DRIFTS for isotopic-labelled 13CO2 and 15N2 reaffirmed the photo-activity of as-synthesized catalysts. Density functional theory provided insight into the relative affinity of different planes of heterostructures towards H2O, CO2 and N2 molecules. The structure-photoactivity rationale behind the intriguing Ag@GaZn sample offers a fundamental insight into the role of plasmonic Ag and design principle of heterostructure with improved photoactivity and stability.
