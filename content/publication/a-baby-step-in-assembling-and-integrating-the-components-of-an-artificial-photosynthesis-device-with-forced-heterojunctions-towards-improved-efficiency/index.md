abstract: How to achieve unassisted, economical, scalable, and sustainable
  artificial photosynthesis for liquid fuels/products with improved
  solar-to-fuel efficiency (STFE) to address a carbon-neutral economy remains a
  big question. To a large degree, the extent of charge separation at
  heterojunction interfaces and charge utilization determine the STFE. Towards
  this, BiVO3 is assembled from ionic-precursors into TiO2 pores, and integrated
  structurally and electronically with TiO2 on calcination as BiVO4 quantum dots
  (BVQDs). BVQDs in TiO2 (BVT) pores lead to an all-inorganic system with a
  sub-quadrillion number of heterojunctions in a 1 cm2 device (contains ∼25 μg
  of BiVO4 (∼2.5 wt%) in the nanopores of ∼975 μg of TiO2 (∼97.5 wt%)) and
  facilitate artificial photosynthesis.
