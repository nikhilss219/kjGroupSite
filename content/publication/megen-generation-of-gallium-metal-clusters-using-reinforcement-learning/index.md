abstract: The generation of low-energy 3D structures of metal clusters depends
  on the efficiency of the search algorithm and the accuracy of inter-atomic
  interaction description. In this work, we formulate the search algorithm as a
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. Concisely, we propose a novel
  actor-critic architecture that generates low-lying isomers of metal clusters
  at a fraction of computational cost than conventional methods. Our RL-based
  search algorithm uses a previously developed DART model as a reward function
  to describe the inter-atomic interactions to validate predicted structures.
  Using the DART model as a reward function incentivizes the RL model to
  generate low-energy structures and helps generate valid structures. We
  demonstrate the advantages of our approach over conventional methods for
  scanning local minima on potential energy surface (PES).
