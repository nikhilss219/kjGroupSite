abstract: CO2, a byproduct from various industrial reactions, must not be
  released into the atmosphere and should be managed through capture,
  conversion, and utilization. The first step in converting CO2 into valuable
  products is to break the CO bond. This work focuses on designing Single Atom
  Catalysts (SACs) by doping Cu (211) surface with 13 different s, p, and d
  block elements with an aim to minimize the activation barrier for CO bond
  cleavage. Our work demonstrates that SACs of Mg/Al/Pt@ Cu (211) favor CO2
  chemisorption compared to Cu (211) where CO2 physisorbs. The barrier for CO2
  dissociation is lowest for Mg@ Cu (211) and it increases in the order Mg@ Cu
  (211)< Al@ Cu (211)< Pt@ Cu (211)< Zn@ Cu (211)< Ga@ Cu (211)< Cu@ Cu (211)<
  Pd@ Cu (211). These findings suggest that doping Cu (211) with earth-abundant
  metal like Mg can potentially be a viable catalyst for CO2 conversion,
  providing a promising solution to reduce carbon footprint
