abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) framework HEART (HydrogEn storAge
  propeRty predicTor) for identifying suitable families of metal alloys for
  hydro- gen storage under ambient conditions. Our framework includes two ML
  models that predict the hydrogen storage capacity (HYST) and the enthalpy of
  hydride formation (THOR) of multi-component metal alloys. We demonstrate that
  a chemically diverse set of features effectively describes the hydrogen
  storage prop-erties of the alloys. In HYST, we use absorption temperature as a
  feature which improved H2wt% prediction significantly. For out-of-the-bag
  samples, HYST predicted H2wt% with R2 score of 0.81 and mean absolute error
  (MAE) of 0.45 wt% whereas R2 score is 0.89 and MAE is 4.53 kJ/molH2 for THOR.
  These models are further employed to predict H2wt% and ∆H for ∼ 6.4 million
  multi-component metal alloys. We have identified 6480 compositions with
  superior storage properties (H2wt% > 2.5 at room temperature and ∆H < 60
  kJ/molH2). We have also discussed in detail the interesting trends picked up
  by these models like temperature dependent variation in H2wt% and alloying
  effect on H2wt%and ∆H in different families of alloys. Importantly certain
  elements like Al, Si, Sc, Cr, and Mn when mixed in small fractions with
  hydriding elements, systematically reduce ∆H without compromising the storage
  capacity. Further upon increasing the number of elements in the alloy i.e from
  binary to ternary to quaternary, the number of compositions with lower
  enthalpies also increases.
